            About OwlScript
        </div>
        <div class='columns'>
            <div>
                <h2>OwlScript is...</h2>
                ... a programming environment built upon and to resemble
                JavaScript.  Its sole purpose is to serve as <span>training</span>
                wheels for <span>programming</span> students of all ages.  It is
                meant to be used by the minimally-competent to teach programming
                to children.


                <h2>Rationale</h2>
                Young computer science students don't care to learn how to sort
                an array.  Nor do they have any interest studying class
                inheritance and counting bits in a byte.  What they do want is
                something to show after hours of typing: a picture.
                <span>OwlCode</span> focuses on graphics primitives:
                circles, lines, rectangles, <i>etc.</i> and the programming
                infrastructure facilitating rendering said primitives.

                <h2>Advantages</h2>
                <span>OwlScript</span> is written in JavaScript due to
                the ubiquity of its interpreter: any modern <span>web
                    browser</span>.<br/></br/>

                <span>OwlScript</span> is self-contained: it can be
                <a href='code.html'>used directly</a> from any modern
                browser, no download necessary.<br/><br/>

                <span>OwlScript</span> can be used <span>without an internet
                connection</span>: <a href='download.html'>download</a>
                it and start programming!<br/><br/>

                <span>OwlScript</span> is syntactially-forgiving: no need
                to declare variables; semicolons at the end of statements
                are not necessary; often-confusing syntactical constructs,
                such as <i>for</i> loops, are simplified; some of the more
                common typos are ignored.
