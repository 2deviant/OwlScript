            About OwlScript

                <h2>OwlScript is...</h2>
                ... a programming environment built upon and to resemble
                JavaScript.  It sole purpose to serve as <span>training</span>
                wheels for <span>programming</span> students of all ages.

                <h2>Rationale</h2>
                Young computer science students don't care to learn how to sort
                an array.  Nor do they have any interest studying class
                inheritance or counting bits in a byte.  What they do what is
                something to show after hours of typing: a picture.
                <span>OwlCode</span>'s focus is on graphics primitives:
                circles, lines, rectangles, <i>etc.</i> and the programming
                infrastructure facilitating rendering thereof.

                <h2>Advantages</h2>
                JavaScript is chosen for the ubiquity of its interpreter:
                any modern <span>web browser</span>.</br></br>

                <span>OwlScript</span> is syntactially-forgiving: no need
                to declare variables; semicolons at the end of statements
                are not necessary; often-confusing syntactical constructs,
                such as <i>for</i> loops, are simplified.
